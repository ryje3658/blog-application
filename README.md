A blogging application wherein users can create accounts
and profiles, create and post content, interact with and
read other user's content, etc.

Users are able to create an account with just a username
and password. Then users can fill out their profile with
basic information and a bio, through their dashboard. From
their dashboard, users can also choose to create a new blog
post, edit or delete an existing one, or communicate with
other users.

Blog posts are sorted by the most recently published on the
front page, though users can choose to sort posts by author,
category, or through an archive wherein they can specify
a time period of posts to view.
